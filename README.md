# To-Do-List

This is a basic To-Do-List Website made in HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Here we can write and save any tasks that we want to do. Once it is completed we can check the completed tasks from the given lists and we can erase it. In this way we can make a new to-do-list again and again and we can delete the tasks once completed.

Three images are used here, one for checking, one for unchecking and another one for icon.
